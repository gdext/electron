# GDExt Electron App

> ⚠️ **THIS PROJECT IS ABANDONED!** Almost none of the features work and probably never will be, as GDExt has stopped development in 2021 and never left pre-alpha

*Please note, that this is NOT the source code for the editor itself, but rather an electron app, in which the editor is contained* 

## Download
